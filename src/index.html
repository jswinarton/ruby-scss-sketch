      <h2>3.1 Size</h2>
      <h3>3.1.1 Don't compose without a scale.</h3>
      <p>The simplest scale is a single note, and sticking with a single note draws more attention to other parameters, such as rhythm and inflection. The early Renaissance typographers set each book in a single font—that is, one face in one size—supplemented by hand-drawn or specially engraved large initial letters for the openings of chapters. Their pages show what sensuous evenness of texture and variety of rhythm can be attained with a single font of type: very much greater than on a typewriter, where letters have, more often than not, a single width and a single stroke-weight as well as a single size. In the sixteenth century, a series of common sizes developed among European typographers, and the series survived with little change and few additions for 400 years. In the early days, the sizes where known by their names rather than numbers, but measured in points, the traditional series is this:</p>
      <p>This is the typographic equivalent of the diatonic scale. But modern equipment makes it possible to set, in addition to these sizes, all the sharps and flats and microtonal intervals between them. Twenty-point, 22-point, 23-point, and 10½-point type are all available for the asking. The designer can now choose a new scale or tone-row for every piece of work. These new resources are useful, but rarely all at once. Use the old familiar scale, or use new scales of your own devising, but limit yourself, at first, to a modest set of distinct and related intervals. Start with one size and work slowly from there. In time, the scales you choose, like the faces you choose, will become recognizable features of personal style.</p>
